Such a powerful extension system also has its drawbacks:
- inherent complexity for new plugin developers
- version conflicts due to dependencies with core and other plugins
- high maintenance installing, configuring and keeping plugins up-to-date
- out-dated, low-quality plugins written by third parties with losing support
