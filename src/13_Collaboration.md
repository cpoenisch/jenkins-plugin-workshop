# Collaboration

The Jenkins project and its huge community are always looking for new contributers and encourage you to participate in many ways. Help others get most out of Jenkins, provide your feedback, review changes to code or documentation, or contribute actively to Jenkins core and the numerous plugins.

As a plugin contributor you can [adopt a plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Adopt+a+Plugin) or pick up a feature request or bug report from the issue tracker and [send a pull request](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Pull+Request+to+Repositories). Alternatively, start [writing a new plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Before+starting+a+new+plugin) if none of the existing plugins cover your needs.
