# Practice

## Task

Show the build name instead of the build number in [Yet Another Build Visualizer](https://plugins.jenkins.io/yet-another-build-visualizer) plugin.

You will change the Build Flow view from

![Build Flow Before](img/yabv_before.png "Build Flow Before")

to named builds

![Build Flow After](img/yabv_after.png "Build Flow After")

<sup>Note: The original change request in [JENKINS-55893](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-55893) has been already implemented with this [commit](https://github.com/jenkinsci/yet-another-build-visualizer-plugin/commit/e23e04439b14cb3510a741e0e35a239d8c666126) but is used to be reimplemented just for learning purposes of this workshop.</sup>
